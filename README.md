MR-DNN: is based on deep learning used to extract rice field from Landsat 8 satellite imagery. Using publicly available satellite imagery data we train a convolutional neural net to predict rice fields in satellite images. MR-DNN achieved tremendous performance for the prediction of rice from Landsat 8 satellite imagery data.
